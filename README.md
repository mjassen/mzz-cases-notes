# mzz-cases-notes
The purpose of this script is to allow the user, let's say a software support agent, to quickly insert a note of what case they just finished working on.

The timestamp auto-updates each time the form is refreshed. JavaScript puts the cursor in the correct field so that the user doesn't have to lift their hands from the keybord before entering the next note.

The notes become saved into a .sqlite database file.
